# Writing Standards

## Purpose
Words and phrases that AI models overuse 10x-200x more than humans. Avoid these terms unless they genuinely fit the context and no simpler alternative exists.

**Rule:** Intentionally avoid these words. Only use when truly necessary for accurate technical communication.

**Top offenders (most likely to slip through):** ensure, actionable, comprehensive, leverage, robust. Extra vigilance on these.

## High-Risk Patterns

## Phrases to Avoid

- "delve into"
- "in the ever-evolving landscape of"
- "leverage synergies"
- "robust and comprehensive"
- "streamline and optimize"
- "it's worth noting that"
- "aims to explore"
- "navigate the complexities"

---

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Don't memorize the list** - let it catch patterns naturally
2. **Context matters** - technical terms like "optimize query performance" are fine
3. **Simpler is better** - if a basic word works, use it
4. **Vary vocabulary** - avoid repeating any word too frequently
5. **Read aloud** - if it sounds stiff or formal, simplify

---

## When These Words ARE Appropriate

- Technical documentation requiring precise terminology
- Direct quotes or references to external sources
- Industry-standard terms with specific meanings (e.g., "optimize database queries")
- When simpler alternatives would sacrifice accuracy

## Self-Check Questions

Before using a blacklisted word, ask:
1. Is there a simpler word that works?
2. Would I say this in conversation?
3. Have I used this word recently in this document?

If yes to #1 or #3, or no to #2 → choose a different word.
